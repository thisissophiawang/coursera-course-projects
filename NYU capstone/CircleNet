CircleNet (Job Searching Analyzer) 
Project Manager: Sophia Wang 

1. Project Goal

The goal of the project is to help CircleNet to develop a job search analysis tool 
in the form of a mobile application for both Android and iOS, using Flutter as the 
programming language. The application will be integrated into a social networking platform.

2. Problem/Opportunity Definition

International students face difficulties in finding job opportunities due to differences
in job markets, cultures, and language barriers. Although there are mobile software options
available in the market, they are either expensive training programs offered by organizations
or free software that lacks the specific features required by international students. 
To address these challenges and provide a solution to the underserved population, CircleNet
aims to develop job search analytic tools that cater to the needs of international students. 
The goal is to make the application accessible and affordable to this population by ensuring
compatibility with both Android and Apple iOS devices. This presents an opportunity for CircleNet
to fill the gap in the market and provide a valuable resource for international students in their job search.
